# web-freelancer
[![StyleCI](https://styleci.io/repos/48709773/shield)](https://styleci.io/repos/48709773)

A tool, built on Laravel to help manage a web freelancer's life.

## Why?

This is my first open source project. I'm coming back to working on the web (making the web!) after some years of university in a field absolutely not related to anything computer-ish and it seems like I don't know anything anymore. Everything changed and it's a bit hard to get back to it - correctly at least. Running this project should at least help me learn what I missed in the past years and, in the end, manage my life as a freelancer. My personnal goals are simple: make something that I can use.

### Contributing

If (hopefully!) there is some people who'd like to help on this project, please reach out! Your participation can and will teach me more and more.

(Yeah, that does mean that PRs are welcomed).

## Goals

Consider this a kind of roadmap for this tool.

- ~~Manage clients (add, edit, delete)~~
- Manage invoicing (create, send(?), accept payment(?), one time and recurring invoices)
- Manage hostings (hosting which site for which client, where, what are the terms, how much do I pay for it, how much to I charge my client, what are the infos (ip, dns, passwords, etc))
- Manage finances (what are the expenses I have as freelancer, what are the incomes, am I in the red or filthy rich)
- Have a better look than basic Laravel/Bootstrap

I'll surely add more in the future
